## Sorting Visualizer

This is a web application used to visualize different sorting algorithms on a random set of data represented by vertical bars.

I made this project to enter into the front-end web development by learning javascript+react and to recap and learn different sorting algorithms.

It is built with Javascript, React.JS and it's also a [progressive web application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps).

You can access a deployed version at [Github pages](https://ciucacosmin109.github.io/SortingVisualizer).
